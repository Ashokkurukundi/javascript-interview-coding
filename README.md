## Introduction

Welcome to the Frontend Interview Coding Round Questions repository! This collection of questions is designed to assist frontend developers in preparing for technical interviews. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, these questions cover a wide range of topics to help you sharpen your skills.

## Questions

### 1. In Memory Search Engine

**Challenge:** Code an in-memory search engine where you can store documents under a particular namespace and search on them. Additionally, allow sorting the search results by passing an `orderBy` parameter.

### 2. Animate Progress Bar in Sequence

**Challenge:** Create a progress bar that takes `n` seconds to complete. Make the progress bar queueable so that, on button click, the progress bar should restart after the current one is completed.

### 3. Toggle function arguments

**Challenge:** 
Create a JavaScript function `toggle` that takes multiple string arguments representing states and returns a function that cycles through and logs these states each time it's called, looping back to the beginning after reaching the end.

### 4. Retry Promises

**Challenge:** 
Implement a function in JavaScript that retries promises N number of times with a delay between each call.

### 5. Efficient Fibonacci Calculation with Memoization

**Challenge:** Create a function to find the nth Fibonacci number efficiently using memoization. Implement `fibonacci(n)` where `n` (0 ≤ n ≤ 100) is the position of the Fibonacci number. Optimize calculations to enhance performance for larger `n` values.
